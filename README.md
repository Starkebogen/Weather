Title              Weather Forecast

Description        Generates an hourly weather forecast for the next 48 hours and a daily summary the next 7 days for
                   each of the locations specified in the file "locations_data.json".

Background         Inspired by the Day 35 exercise in Doctor Angela Yu's excellent Python course "100 Days of Code -
                   The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021", which is available on www.udemy.com.  The difference
                   between this program and the course exercise is that this program produces daily and hourly weather
                   reports for multiple locations, whereas the course exercise sends a single SMS alert advising whether
                   inclement weather (i.e. rain or snow) is expected within the next twelve hours for a single location.
